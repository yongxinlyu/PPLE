# About PPLE

Personalised Programming Language Enhancement (PPLE) is a creative and collaborative social club designed for learners who want to take their programming skills to the next level—especially in Python.

At PPLE, participants work on personalized coding projects based on their interests—whether it’s web development, automation, data science, game design, or something entirely unique. With mentorship, peer feedback, and flexible goals, members grow not only their coding proficiency but also their ability to think like developers.

This is a space for exploration, experimentation, and expression through code.
