# Course Description

The recent surge in the volume of data collected owing to technological advances provides opportunities to improve processes and take better decisions across various industries.

However, in order to turn large data sets into useful insights, combining the knowledge of right
data with right analytical tools is important. Data-driven decision making is an industry-oriented
course where students learn data management and analytic skills through a major project and
real case studies from the Schoolâ€™s research strengths/industrial experience in chemical
engineering and food science.

In this course, you will discover advanced methods for obtaining, handling and summarising
various categories of data with databases. The course will also focus on how to analyse the
collected data efficiently by applying sophisticated analytical techniques including statistical
tests, inferences and regression analysis.

A working knowledge of introductory statistics and introductory programming is assumed.
