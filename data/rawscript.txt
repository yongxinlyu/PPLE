yeah thanks for the invitation to speak so i tried to make this summoner a little bit i guess materials project
0:06
themed so some of the questions are razor sort of inspired by um being a user
0:11
um of the materials project for quite a while and i'm going to jump straight in and
0:19
so for materials modeling i think the typical workflow is that we want to map between structure and properties
0:26
so that's typically it we use different codes different approaches but we want to make that mapping
0:32
and i think you can break it up into three parts so usually we have an input that's a crystal structure and often
0:39
it's either directly from x-ray diffraction experiments or if it's it's inspired by diffraction
0:45
experiments so you're taking the structure of a known material and maybe changing the composition or
0:51
modifying the structure in a particular way of course one of the pioneers in in modern crystallography was kathleen
0:57
lonsdale just pointing to her and then we have to make a choice in the
1:03
hamiltonian so the interactions that we want to describe in the system and the interactions between electrons
1:10
between ion and electrons for example and of course this follows hamiltonian
1:15
mechanics that was developed by william hamilton and then we want to think about the properties of the system that we care
1:21
about so it could be mechanical properties optical electronic
1:26
and i think the job of a computational scientist is really to choose
1:32
the hamiltonian that's appropriate for the system of interest for that chemistry for that structure
1:38
type and also for the property that you care about and so you might make a particular
1:43
choice if you care about magnetism and you could get away with sort of a model hamiltonian that describes exchange
1:49
interactions between electrons and so you could predict for example magnetic susceptibility
1:55
and but generally in first principles of materials modeling we want to have a hamiltonian that's as complete as
2:01
possible so we want to describe as many of the interactions in our system that we can
2:08
to make the predictions as general as possible and so that's a point i'll come back to
2:13
a little bit later and but what i would say is that practically um we have to make choices
2:20
so choices that are pragmatic that we can actually we have a hamiltonian that we can solve for our system in a
2:26
reasonable time frame and sort of going back to this early quote from paul dirac
2:31
so it follows he said at the time that chemistry was a solved problem so quantum mechanics had been developed
2:38
in the early 20th century and because the schrodinger or direct equation
2:43
can describe the electronic distribution of any combination of elements therefore chemistry was solved but the practical
2:51
problem was the equations were too difficult to solve for any realistic system so this is a quote from one of
2:58
his papers so approximate method should be developed which can lead to an explanation of the main features of
3:04
complex atomic systems without too much computation and this really sums up the next century
3:10
of effort and in theoretical and computational science so trying to reduce
3:17
sort of the schrodinger direct equations which describe all of the physics and of
3:22
the systems we care about into a form that's tractable and i think now typically we deal with
3:28
sort of different sets of approximations so we have analytical expressions
3:33
such as like leonard jones or buckingham and where we have a
3:38
closed form that describes the interaction between elements so when the elements get too close you
3:44
get the um you get um repulsion when the you have sort of a
3:50
sweet spot for the equilibrium bond length and then you have sort of longer range van der waals interactions so
3:56
that's sort of leonard jones type of course that's very straightforward to
4:01
deal with computationally so now we can have classical force field simulations
4:06
for systems of millions or billions of atoms so still very powerful techniques
4:12
but maybe the majority of super computing time at least public super super computing time right now would be
4:18
spent on numerical solutions um of for example the conscham equations
4:24
so there we make particular approximations to make the equation solvable and for sort of systems that we care
4:30
about so usually systems ranging i guess from a couple to hundreds or sometimes thousands of atoms
4:37
and then more recently we have a whole new set of statistical approximations and so using machine learning we can
4:43
also describe interactions between elements we can describe structure
4:49
and composition property relationships and so this is really taking advantage of machine learning models as function
4:56
approximators so if we don't know the exact function that relates the
5:01
input structure to the output property perhaps we can and train a model that
5:07
will a machine learning model that will describe it okay so that was paul dirac in the late
5:13
1920s if you move forward a few decades and at that particular time so this
5:20
really the development of modern computing started and charles coulson wrote a very nice essay on a split in
5:27
the field of theoretical chemistry so those theoretical chemists that were
5:32
focused on having accurate analytical solutions
5:38
of sort of quantum mechanical problems of several electrons interacting and there's a group of people working on
5:45
sort of approximations to allow allow us to treat larger and more complex systems
5:50
and but he worked out sort of the information that you need to encode to describe the interacting wave function
5:56
of 20 electrons and figure out that surpassed and what would be possible in the
6:02
foreseeable future so he made this prediction that around 20 electrons would be an upper limit to
6:07
what would ever be possible to calculate and of course he couldn't really see what was what was coming in the future
6:14
and and these days it's becoming possible to solve sort of control equations for systems of definitely
6:20
hundreds or thousands of electrons so for example this methyl organic framework qio66
6:26
and if you're treating it in an all-electron simulation the unit cell has 752 electrons
6:32
and but yet we can do it now for two reasons so one is that we have much larger
6:37
computers so if you look at top 500 so the ranking of public supercomputers we now have
6:44
many systems with over 1 million processors and which is quite incredible how
6:50
quickly and the complexity of supercomputers has grown and including some nice ones in the us
6:57
and but you also have to pay attention to the power usage so some of these like taking um
7:03
sort of 29 000 kilowatts of power for the number one supercomputer that
7:08
basically would require an old-fashioned coal power plant just to power that one
7:13
supercomputer and in terms of the in terms of the capacity so it's definitely something that's playing on my mind in
7:20
terms of how we can be as efficient as possible in our use of resource and i think databases such as the materials
7:27
project is one way that we can reduce sort of the the need to
7:32
keep re-running the same calculations over and over so definitely one side parallel computing is playing a big role
7:38
in able to sort of brute force and solve these equations for larger systems
7:45
and then of course we have the algorithms that are sort of powering uh powering them
7:50
and a common bottleneck in in first principles modeling is simply matrix diagonalization
7:56
so as a matrix gets larger and larger so as you have more basis functions it becomes much more difficult to
8:03
distribute that task on many processors and but there has been a lot of work in in applied maths and computer science
8:10
in making this more efficient so i use the code fha aims a lot that
8:16
and and they've been involved in the development of this alpha library which has been been really impressive in the
8:21
rate of progress that now so you can start to diagonalize a matrix that has more than
8:28
of dimensions greater than 500 000 using sort of over 20 000 cores quite
8:34
efficiently so 3d thanks to hardware and some of these software developments that we can start to
8:40
go beyond treating very simple systems using dft start to treat things such as
8:45
dislocations and grain boundaries that wouldn't have been possible and even five or ten years ago
8:53
so that was a little bit of context and so i said this this seminar i want to make a little bit bespoke and and
8:59
i've broken it up into at least past present and future
9:04
as i see it in terms of materials modeling but sort of drawing i guess from my progression and over the years
9:12
and so i started my phd about 20 years ago and i think a lot has changed since then and that
9:19
was really when we were doing one compound at a time with dft so these calculations are very expensive
9:25
we're using reasonable and super computing clusters to solve control equations for relatively simple
9:32
systems and so my phd was focused on understanding so connections between chemistry crystal structure and physical
9:39
properties and with a strong focus on post-transition metal compounds so looking at for example the
9:46
differences between tin dioxide so sno2 versus is tin monoxide so sno
9:53
so it changes large changes in the crystal structure in the band structure and in the
9:59
semiconducting properties and towards the end of my phd we actually got a new supercomputer in
10:06
dublin i actually can't remember the size right now and but enable it it enables us to do
10:12
larger calculations than ever before so i was very excited to work on this system bismuth standards
10:18
so this was the most complex inorganic crystal structure that had been solved from powder diffraction at the time
10:23
so i think over 300 atoms in the unit cell and so we're able to solve the electronic structure and look at some of
10:29
the sort of some of the interesting features associated with this bismuth lone pair so you can see this asymmetric
10:36
electron density but at the time it seemed like very fundamental work sort of just looking at
10:42
interactions between bismuth and oxygen and business and sulfur and it was just later in my career somehow these lone
10:49
pairs kept coming back and so applications in terms of electrocatalysts and photocatalysts and
10:55
solar cells and a range of materials these sort of lone pair states ended up
11:01
re-emerging and primarily as a way to increase conductivity and increase absorption in
11:07
the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum so systems like bismuth-vanidate are being quite widely used as um
11:14
photo catalysts for water splitting but that was my phd and but for my
11:20
post-doctoral research i wanted to get a little bit more applied so i ended up moving to colorado and to
11:26
work at the national renewable energy lab where my focus was on high throughput simulations
11:32
so there i had access to much larger computers thanks to the us department of energy and we could think about running
11:38
many dft calculations so orders of magnitude more than i was doing for my phd
11:45
and at the time i was quite inspired by mineral structures and the idea of taking these sort of
11:50
prototype structures for example here is the kesterite mineral that can be found
11:55
in russia and thinking about substituting in alternative elements
12:00
and looking at the possible chemical space that could be formed inside those mineral structures
12:06
and and that was a really fun time and so kestrel actually forms a diamond based um super lattice so you
12:14
have this sort of zinc blend diamond structure that you can populate with a single element it's
12:19
diamond two elements it's a blend three element it's a caltraparite and four
12:24
elements it's kesterite and then you can think about the possible chemical space that you can access by substituting in those elements
12:32
and so of course there are a number of known compounds binary ternary quaternary but there's also a large
12:37
number of unknown and that perhaps could be made so we spent a long time exploring and
12:44
performing many such calculations and really cool things so within that single crystal space
12:51
we identified potential and materials for solar cells and spin transport materials are very
12:57
strong spin over coupling and also a family of topological insulators
13:02
and so that was a really productive time using dft to be quite exploratory in
13:07
terms of crystal space but what i would say so i was trained formally as a computational chemist and
13:14
you can see i was getting quite deep into condensed matter physics so i had a chance i got a marie curie
13:20
fellowship to move to the uk and sort of think about my research direction
13:25
a little bit so i decided to combine my interest in chemistry and physics and devote some time to organic
13:32
inorganic systems so paying attention to some emerging activity in the field of
13:37
hybrid semiconductors so materials formed from inorganic and organic building blocks but yet they
13:44
could still conduct charge so quite different to the sort of first wave of metal organic frameworks that were very
13:50
much wide band gap and dielectric insulators so systems such as this that is
13:56
um sort of a mixture of lead sulfide and these sort of aromatic rings and you
14:02
give rise to very low effective masses and some quite high levels of conductivity
14:07
and that ended up being quite a strong stream of research for me so trying to translate concepts from semiconductor
14:14
physics so things like band engineering and to the field of hybrid solids or
14:20
metal organic frameworks so in this particular case taking a
14:25
quite a wide band gap and wider band gap but yet photoactive crystal and making serious substitutions
14:32
on the ligands they tried to control and the band energies so that was
14:38
a pretty fun time but what i would say sort of back then 10 years ago
14:43
it was incredibly difficult to set up calculations for metal organic frameworks
14:48
and so often the structures you get from experiment are quite incomplete so usually missing hydrogen and quite often
14:55
you have partial occupancies because of how they refine the structures do you have some sort of orientation
15:02
orientational flexibility in ligands so then they end up fitting a 50 site here 50 site here
15:09
so there was a lot of manual effort to actually parse the experimental sifs into something that you could run
15:16
a dft calculation on and so it's been really nice to see a lot of progress in that area to make and
15:22
these types of frameworks more tractable i think one nice initiative and came out from from northwestern and coremof which
15:30
is a data set of computational ready meta-organic frameworks so trying to add hydrogens removing disorder and having a
15:37
list of structures that you could really plug and play and then of course this year we've just seen and a launching materials project
15:44
so the maf explorer and it get incredibly exciting to be able to go through so many different maps
15:51
and and see the range of predicted properties and so i think andrew rosen he did a really nice job with the qmof
15:57
database which was published last year the year before and and
16:03
has implemented this in in the materials project so i think this is a really nice feature
16:09
for people working in the area so that was really when i was starting
16:14
my research group and i still remember my first phd student
16:19
he was a few months into his phd and he came to me and said aaron we're in trouble
16:25
and there's a website that's already done the calculations you asked me to do and so this is uh lee burton and his phd
16:32
was focused on tin sulfide solar cells so sns related and so one of his first tasks
16:38
was to sort of perform some thermodynamic calculations and come up with a convex hole
16:44
for the tin sulfide system and so he found materialsproject.org and found actually there was a convex
16:50
hole there already and he was a little bit depressed because he's like now what am i going to do for my phd
16:56
but still there was a lot more to do there was extra phases and there's quite a strong sensitivity to the functional
17:02
but nonetheless that was my first i think introduction to materials project and for me it was quite eye-opening
17:09
so it was a real shift in mentality so it sort of standardized a lot of the ground states sort of dft calculations
17:17
of perfect crystals and raise the bar for the types of research problems that we could start to
17:22
tackle so instead of reproducing all of these and sort of simple reference systems why
17:28
not use that data and try to do something more interesting okay
17:34
so that brings me to the well closer to the present um
17:40
but what i would say my next step so once i found materials project and that made me think about materials
17:46
data and thinking about even larger chemical spaces so i ended up going back to some of the
17:51
quite early research papers i had been reading when i was working at nrel so work in the 1950s and 60s
17:58
when so people were thinking about electron counting uh related to semiconductors so there was a
18:06
number of semiconducting families so binary ternaries and quaternary that had been uncharacterized at the time
18:13
and people like brian pamplin started to think about actually what other semiconductors could exist
18:20
if we take into account sort of valen valence electron counting rules there should be a whole range of
18:27
and multi-component semiconductors that should be accessible but at the time it was really just based
18:33
on electron counting there's no other metric to say sort of would those materials be chemically sensible or
18:38
would they be stable and so that inspired us to put together i think a relatively simple
18:45
and package called smacked so semiconductor materials from analogy and chemical theory
18:50
and so directly inspired for the work of brian pamplin and others at the time
18:55
but the idea was to and put together a package that could deal with elements
19:01
and some simple chemical features so that we could explore spaces for sort of millions of combinations
19:08
and try to filter which ones could be feasible or not and i think the first person to commit
19:14
some code was keith butler and he was a postdoc in my group at the time and now he's a staff scientist
19:20
in the scientific machine learning division at sdfc so a uk national lab
19:27
and then we had many contributions from undergraduate researchers so then this was a really great way to
19:33
introduce python and introduce some basic package management to various students uh throughout the years
19:40
and i think dan davis was one of the main contributors and he worked on smackd during his phd
19:45
and i think he had a visit to berkeley and towards the end of his phd but many other other contributors along
19:51
the way and anthony he's working on smacked um right now
19:57
but i think the key approximation at the beginning was really trying to simplify the problem of
20:02
exploring chemical spaces so saying okay let's ignore structure let's try to explore and build models
20:09
based purely on composition or element features so can we look at balancing
20:15
charge balancing electronegativities having some metrics for stable oxidation states
20:22
and things like that so that was sort of the that was the approach that we followed
20:28
but towards the end of his phd dan i think he was getting quite ambitious in terms
20:34
of okay if you want to start to make um strong predictions that could be verified experimentally you really have
20:41
to integrate structure so then we started to work on metrics for predicting structure quite
20:46
efficiently and so one of the bottlenecks dan had faced and was the lack of description of
20:52
structure in trying to train element only models and the issue that you really have is
20:59
and the inability to describe polymorphs and so here is just the distribution of
21:04
band gaps and in the materials project for materials with the same composition
21:11
so it's looking at the spread in bandgap as a property and across different polymorphs
21:17
and you can see for some materials there's actually quite a large difference so you can have up to a two electron
21:22
volt difference the same composition in two different structures and so this is going to set a limit to
21:28
the accuracy of any derived models that don't include structure as a feature
21:34
and so that made us sort of take a step back and really think about integrating more structure features
21:40
and more sophisticated or faster ways to predict structure and directly from
21:45
compositions but i would say since then back in 2019 of course there has been a lot of progress in more complex and elemental
21:53
features and i'm sure taylor sparks will talk about that next month but in terms of encoding
21:58
sort of more than just the sort of elemental identity into it into a structure feature
22:05
but i just wanted to give one example where i think structure has been very important um in in my sort of recent
22:11
work and that would be the perovskite system and probably many of you whether you
22:16
like them or not you you've come across the perovskite structure at some stage and but the simple sort of high symmetry
22:24
prototype is relatively straightforward it's a cubic structure and a primitive unit
22:30
cell with five five atoms in the basis and the crystal structure was determined back in 1925
22:37
with the structure of the mineral form of calcium titanate but the interesting thing about
22:42
perovskites is not that cubic sort of parent structure it's all of the derived lower symmetry
22:48
structures that can emerge from that and so it's been shown that there's 23
22:53
distinct types of lower symmetry perovskites that can emerge from tilting of those octahedra
23:01
and you can connect them according to group theory so you have the high symmetry cubic structure on top
23:06
then you start to remove particular symmetry elements so you can form a
23:11
tetragonal structure remove another symmetry element from an orthorhombic structure
23:17
another one from a monophenic structure so you have this family of related structures
23:23
they're all based on abx-3 they're all based on connected octahedra but it's just the deformations of those octahedra
23:31
and that vary and but my particular interest has been in the subclass of hybrid halide
23:37
perovskites so these gained a lot of attention for applications in solar cells and leds
23:43
and even these days for memristors and other applications and the difference here is that one of
23:49
the elemental components of the perovskite is replaced by a molecule so it could be something like
23:54
methylamonium or formamidinium or dna or mda and so different molecules will sit
24:01
on a lattice site that is occupied by a charged ion in a regular perovskite
24:08
and the really interesting thing is that these materials if you have metal ammonium leaked chloride for example and
24:14
they still occupy the regular perovskite structures so these colors represent different compositions that have been reported in
24:21
various space groups corresponding to tilted and tilted perovskites and polymorphs
24:28
so a lot of the previous knowledge in terms of the crystallography of oxide perovskites
24:34
translated very well to the family of hybrid halide materials
24:40
and one of the first things we noticed when we started to sort of look at these in a little bit more detail
24:45
is that although the x-ray diffraction tells you one story maybe there's a particular high symmetry and perovskite
24:52
structure that's present when we look locally for example when you do molecular dynamic simulations
24:58
you see a lot of disorder so you see vibrations and rotations of the molecular building blocks
25:05
and you see a lot of motion in the underlying in this case lead iodine framework so a lot of things happening
25:11
and it made us realize that these structures are highly dynamic and they're not fully described by brag
25:17
diffraction which is really an average over space and time so if we look at the distribution and of
25:24
the ions in the system from room temperature and mature dynamic simulations what you see okay the
25:29
average crystallographic position is indeed um at the center of the distributions
25:35
but you have very large deviations from the average positions and at the beginning i would say we're a
25:41
little bit confused about these that are very um elongated ellipsoids around the iodine
25:47
positions in the structure but of course it makes a lot of sense when you think about tilting of octahedra
25:53
because this tilting sort of maps out a ellipsoid rather than a sphere so you have these very asymmetric
26:00
um lobes that are are mapped out but from the iron distributions
26:05
and so we were sort of shouting to the community a little bit about the some of these features and it managed to get a
26:11
very nice collaboration with the group of simon billings at columbia university in new york
26:17
and so he's an expert in inelastic scattering which is a way to probe the local structure
26:23
and so we've got a very nice validation that indeed although brag diffraction was telling us one
26:28
thing about the symmetry of these perovskite halide perovskite structures that are sort of
26:34
quite averaged locally there's a lot more happening and
26:39
essentially from the inelastic measurements you can in you can um analyze the pair distribution function
26:46
and what you find is that over different length scales you have the best fit to different crystal structure types
26:53
so when you look over long length scales for this particular material at this temperature you get a best fit to a
26:58
cubic perovskite structure but when you look over shorter length scales you get a best fit to a polar um
27:05
tetragonal and space group so there's a difference between the short range features and the long range
27:11
behavior and so that was back and so back in 2016 but since then i think experimentally
27:18
we've been able to probe over shorter and shorter length scales in very nice ways
27:23
and so i did a collaboration in this case with tiernan doherty and who's a phd student
27:30
with some strengths in cambridge and they've been using selected area electron diffraction
27:36
to take some very high performance perovskite solars and films and look at the changes in structure
27:42
within a grain and between grains and remarkably they can see several things
27:48
so you can see string gradients within a grain so you see that the effective lattice constant varies within the grain so you
27:55
have built-in strain in these high performance films but also you have a range of different polymorphs that coexist
28:02
so you can have tetragonal phases you can have hexagonal polytypes you can have cubic phases that all coexist
28:09
within these high performance films and so these perovskites are extremely heterogeneous
28:17
so this is really pushing us to think how we can model such things so the mixture of phases that are present at
28:23
once um in these films at room temperature and so thinking about larger scale simulations and how we can map out these
28:30
local distortions in a more efficient way and so my student kazuki morita he spent
28:38
quite a bit of time thinking of how he could efficiently featurize and distortions in octahedral systems
28:45
and so going back to some simple group theory and the possible ways that you can deform an octahedron so he realized
28:52
there's actually only four unique modes so you can take any octahedron and if
28:57
it's distorted you can map it in essentially into four dimensions so this ends up being a very convenient
29:03
way to if you're given a set of structures and
29:08
either separate structures or a structure that's very large and you have a series of distortions over space
29:15
this is one way that enables you to classify those distortions and so to test the protocol he put
29:22
together so he initially looked at um ab03 octahedra inside the materials project
29:30
so he's able to extract 552 octahedra and this is the distribution of
29:36
distortions so the the index of those four modes for those octahedra
29:41
and so you can see quite a large spread so you end up getting a peak at zero when you for
29:47
example if you have a cubic polymorph so you have a perfect octahedron so it
29:53
could be rock salt it could be a cubic perovskite then you have no distortions
29:58
but there are a number of structure types and materials that exhibit large
30:03
distortions over quite a large range so this was quite cool that we could see
30:08
that a series of distortions were present and digging a little bit further and kazuki found that distortions classified
30:16
very nicely according to the connectivity between octahedra so whether you have corner
30:23
sharing networks or edge sharing networks or face sharing networks or some combination of corner sharing
30:29
and face sharing so the distortions really broke down into these separate sets
30:35
and so in this case you get the strongest distortions in the combination of these two particular modes
30:41
when you have a mixture of corner and face sharing and connectivities and so
30:47
yeah there's some quite nice findings in that particular paper but i don't want to draw on it too long but what kazuki found
30:54
quite surprisingly and this is really thanks to one of the reviewers pushing us to do this and so he performed a series of
31:00
molecular dynamic simulations for some halide perovskites and found that a very simple
31:06
supervised model that just tried to reproduce the energies from the md so a really minimalist model where the
31:12
only features were the distortions of the octahedra did a very good job so with four dimensions you could get a
31:20
very good fit to the energies so this this just shows that group theory can be quite useful in terms of informing us in
31:27
efficient representations of structure so there's a lot of knowledge built in
31:32
crystallography that we can remap to have more efficient models for training and in machine learning
31:40
so yeah we're using it for molecular dynamics and but we're also applying it now to look at more complex perovskite
31:46
polytypes and so jen julie is a postdoc in my group and she's wrote a nice package for
31:52
generating very complex perovskite sequences so we have mixtures of different
31:58
connectivities between corner and face sharing and sometimes it's described as a mixture of um cubic and hexagonal poly
32:05
types and then we can perform various and various analysis to see what type of
32:12
distortions emerge because there's increasing evidence that these types of intergroups
32:17
appear both in oxide and in halide perovskite films so because you have a very delicate
32:23
balance between sometimes these hexagonal and cubic networks that in reality at room temperature you
32:30
end up getting some mixture of the two and so that's a really fun topic that's sort of attracting our attention
32:39
okay that brings me to the future so to get back to my title of the grand truth
32:46
and so i mentioned i i can't remember exactly what the title was but something about uh the grand truth is out there
32:53
and so when you think about the grand truth of quantum mechanics so i think we're really lucky in a way that
32:58
compared to many other fields we have the ability to generate our own data
33:03
so we can make predictions for example with machine learning model of a particular property but we have the
33:09
ability to calculate we can go back we can solve a set of equations and predict what that value is
33:15
so i think that active learning and is really going to be a very exciting opportunity in in materials design in
33:22
the future but nonetheless so grand truth of my quantum mechanics so what we want is a complete
33:28
description of all interactions in our system so if you think we have a crystal that crystal has
33:34
atoms sitting at particular sites we want to describe all the interactions between atoms in those in the particular
33:41
crystal that gives us exact properties of the system so you can start to write down the
33:47
hamiltonian it may include all the interactions that you need usually the first term is the atom sitting at their
33:54
positions that generates a periodic potential that periodic potential distributes the
34:00
electrons that defines the chemical bonds and from that we can determine the energy so that
34:07
would be the internal energy of the system but depending on the system if you have a small gap
34:13
or if it's a magnetic system where you have different configurations that can emerge then you have excitations if
34:20
they're low energy they're going to perturb that static crystal potential
34:25
you also have vibrations and in the simplest approximations you have harmonic vibrations the atoms are
34:32
moving in a harmonic potential so then we have a number of almost analytic terms we can incorporate
34:38
to modify the energies to modify the properties but increasingly for materials research
34:44
we're driven in a direction where is becoming increasingly important so if you're interested in
34:50
thermoelectrics it's all about tuning thermal conductivity thermal conductivity is only defined
34:57
when you have these and harmonic terms so you also have to include some description of an hermann and harmonicity
35:04
and then you have coupling between vibrations and the electronic states so you have electron
35:10
phonon coupling to incorporate as well so you think about this mega hamiltonian that starts to describe all of the
35:16
interactions that are at play to describe the properties that a material has at finite temperatures
35:23
which is sort of real temperatures at room temperature but often what we do
35:28
mainly because it's convenient or it makes our job a little bit easier
35:34
we strike out all of the other terms we say okay let's just keep the static potential
35:40
let's assume we have a crystal that's static the atoms don't move
35:45
they are the properties job done that's okay in some cases but of course
35:52
we're missing many things we're missing free energies so we don't have any temperature or true pressure
35:58
dependence in the phase diagrams and we're missing thermal expansion which could be positive or could be
36:04
negative it might be isotropic it might be an isotropic thermal expansion can have a big effect
36:10
on properties whether it's mechanical instead of changing a bulk modulus whether it's changing a band gap
36:17
and basically every property is going to depend on how a material expands and the halide perovskites i mentioned
36:22
before they have some of the largest thermal expansion coefficients of any known solid
36:28
so you end up having very big changes in structure at room temperature so if you do a static calculation
36:35
and i say here a thermal because we have no description of temperature not even zero point motion
36:40
then we have a built-in error and of course to explicit electron
36:46
phonon interactions can be very important in some cases as well so we have all of these extra terms that
36:51
we may want to include and of course there are ways to include them so for example if we go to the
36:57
quasi-harmonic approximation this is sort of a cheap and cheerful way to include the effect of temperature
37:04
so you have a free energy that depends on the volume of the system essentially what you do is
37:11
and minimize the volume at for a given temperature you find the volume that minimizes the free energy at
37:16
a given temperature so for these um rock salt systems you have the lattice
37:22
constant that changes with temperature and therefore we can we can look at the
37:28
how a property changes as the structure changes and in this case the bulk modulus can
37:33
easily change by about 30 percent and when a crystal expands from zero kelvin
37:39
to room temperature i say cheap and cheerful buzzer harmonic works quite well for many cases
37:46
but still it's quite approximate now one of the reasons is it's not it can't describe changes in internal
37:53
degrees of freedom very well so you have to go beyond the quasi-harmonic approximation
37:58
and in terms of describing these sort of unharmonic contributions to structure to
38:04
free energies to properties there's been an incredible incredible amount of progress over the
38:09
past three to five years in new methods but many of them are using things like
38:16
compressed sensing so instead of explicitly calculating all the terms you can sample the anharmonicity and
38:22
come up with some effective correction and so at tadano in in scuba he's been
38:29
doing some really nice work developing the aloe mode code and to include some of those corrections
38:34
and so he published this preprint and and last autumn
38:40
so looking at terms that are missing in the quasi-harmonic approximation very interesting to me because before
38:45
that people we knew there are some things missing but the quasi-harmonic approximation is
38:50
a little bit peculiar because it's not part of any formal expansion in terms of
38:56
many body theory so it sort of combines a mixture of different terms
39:01
but this paper he actually tries to quantify what terms are missing and what's quite curious even systems
39:07
like sodium chloride and magnesium oxide they're classified as strongly and harmonic
39:13
so at least me i'd have the intuition that a rock-solid crystal should be quite robust you don't have to worry too much
39:20
about anaerobicity but actually it's not the case there's a lot of interaction between vibrations
39:28
that's i think one dimension you can look down and and just heart from heart from
39:34
twitter so this this particular and tweet got my attention yesterday
39:40
so maya wrote i don't like people who neglect spin over coupling that's it i've said it
39:45
and i felt a little bit hurt like she could could have been talking to me because there's many cases where we have to
39:52
neglect spin-orbit coupling because it's expensive not because we don't know it's important so for example in the halide
39:59
perfect guides which contain lead we know spin orbit coupling is important but primarily it affects the conduction
40:06
band where the p band that's formerly empty so we can make assumptions that maybe the dynamics are not so much affected
40:13
electrodynamics should be okay vibration should be reasonable and we do have some evidence to back that up
40:19
but generally it can be difficult to justify why we neglect such effects
40:25
and in fact a few years ago this actually reminded me so with dan davis i had a collaboration with an above
40:32
sort of looking at some trends in spin orbit coupling so taking sets of materials from the materials project
40:38
including spin orbit coupling and looking at the impact and here's a series of plots so they're
40:45
band gap differences so the difference in band gap and calculated with spin-orbit coupling and
40:53
without spin-over coupling and there's a general assumption that spin-orbit coupling is a constant for a
40:58
particular element so if you think you have lead you have tin present you're going to result it's
41:04
going to result in some correction that you need add a shift in the chemical potential add a constant term and that's
41:10
going to fix your calculations but what we found quite scarily that there's actually
41:17
quite a large distribution for these heavy elements in the corrections so just looking at lead there's
41:23
variation between no band gap shift down to a 0.1
41:29
1.4 electron volt band gap shift and initially i thought that was a bit
41:34
strange and so i got done to break it down in terms of oxidation state so you see actually there's
41:40
many more lead to compounds so most of the distribution isn't led to then i thought okay
41:46
it must depend either on the coordination environment or on the anion that's present
41:52
but yet we couldn't see any clear correlation so that's a these plots are trying to show and i think the timing was a little bit
41:58
early we didn't have any good sort of featurization of structure
42:03
that we could have plugged in and i think this could really be revisited with some supervised machine learning to
42:09
try to identify some particular correlations to see what features are driving these
42:14
distributions could also be that the data was slightly anomalous that's that's possible as well
42:21
but still it shows the spurious errors that can be built in when we
42:26
choose a fixed hamiltonian and expect it to be transferable from any materials
42:32
so this got me thinking but
42:37
maybe just from another perspective so in terms of materials data and databases so i think from the user
42:43
of course we want to have absolute data please do the best quality calculations
42:48
you can give us the best data so that we can use them in our trained models or in fair
42:54
for sort of our various predictions so you can think of it like a jacob's ladder so we want to get up to heaven
43:02
and that's from the user perspective so we want the best data possible but i do realize from the curator
43:08
perspective so if you're maintaining or running the calculations with these databases
43:13
it might be more similar to a dante's inferno so you have all of these rings of hell that you have to get through
43:19
because different approximations it can be tricky you end up errors that
43:25
errors crop up for particular chemistries that you can no longer avoid and and you can
43:32
have other issues maybe a pseudo potential cannot be used for that particular type of calculation so it's very difficult to have
43:38
systematic data for all materials so there is a balance there
43:45
but what i would say so how i'm using materials databases and materials project and pi match n at the moment so
43:52
just to give you an idea so i'm using it in my undergraduate teaching so my first year undergrads and in
43:59
materials at imperial they all get to use materials project and in the introduction to
44:04
crystallography i get them to make their accounts to download structures to play with those structures
44:11
so that's really really useful uh for my postgraduate teaching um i get
44:16
you typically get them to use the python api so to actually get an experience of
44:22
queries of extracting data from databases again very very useful
44:28
and then for research projects i love the website for informal project planning so during seminars if somebody
44:34
mentions an interesting compound i'm straight to materials project to check it out some basic properties
44:40
and then of course for data driven projects having that resource of systematic data is invaluable so i
44:46
really appreciate all of the effort that goes into maintaining such a database so both in terms of the
44:54
energies but also the structures that are there
44:59
but then on the other side of course you do have some perils and i think many people enter this field
45:05
perhaps not from the computational science background and sometimes they may have the belief
45:11
that this data is absolute that these are the energies these are
45:16
the band gaps these are the phase diagrams that is the truth if i build a
45:21
model that can reproduce it then i've solved everything but i think we know
45:26
that's not really the case and that there can be many hidden errors
45:33
but something else that actually caught my interest recently so some of you may have read the book
45:38
from christoph molnar so he wrote a very nice open source textbook on interpretable
45:44
machine learning so the various approaches that you can use to open up black box models in
45:49
different ways and so he posted this recently so i think you've become a little bit cynical
45:55
about machine learning in general so this is not specifically for materials but that machine learning research has
46:01
detached itself from solving real problems and created benchmark islands
46:07
that there's these very large data sets and it seems to be what people want to do is just develop
46:12
models that can reproduce those data sets with less
46:19
error and so he highlighted a number of what he called warning signs
46:24
so the predictive models is its sole measure of progress that the original motivations and assumptions for
46:30
developing these models are no longer questioned and the actual progress in solving the overarching research questions
46:37
have become irrelevant or even discouraged i don't think we're there yet for
46:42
materials i think we're really at the formative stages where people are taking different models seeing how they
46:48
work trying to develop more accurate and approaches more general more transferable but i think it's quite
46:55
useful just to pay attention to these warning signs as an editor as a reader and i do come
47:02
across a number of papers so sometimes i read them and think is that useful for me
47:08
as a solid state chemistry physicist um but yeah they can be useful in terms of
47:13
developing the general infrastructure but i think sometimes we have to think about these overarching questions of the
47:20
big problems that we're trying to solve and i think one of them at least for me is thinking about new chemical spaces
47:27
so often we're looking for materials with particular properties or to meet a particular figure of merit
47:34
and i think there are an increasing number of daft predictions in the literature and but sometimes we have a set of very
47:41
powerful tools um but we just need to have that balance between sort of exploring new chemical
47:47
spaces and being careful of what we're saying is going to be the next great material
47:52
and i think alex zunger was really on point in this commentary in nature a few years ago on the burden of proof
48:00
that we have as materials modelers when we make predictions of
48:05
a new system that has particular property making sure that it's as realistic as possible
48:12
and i think at this point in time so we have many indicators of stability
48:18
so you can think in terms of thermodynamics of locally heat information it's it's usually quite
48:24
optimistic and you can think globally about convex hulls maybe an open environment interaction with
48:30
oxygen or water you can think kinetically about the phonons but it's usually quite small
48:35
displacements you could think about molecular dynamics or maybe even monte carlo methods
48:40
or come up with a model for synthesizability for machine learning
48:45
i think we have many indicators right now but personally i haven't seen a quantitative stability figure of merit
48:53
or machine learning model that i'm really convinced by and i think it's really very much a work
48:59
in progress and i'm excited to see where the community is going to go over the next few years in terms of being able to
49:05
predict these realistic candidates and more efficiently
49:11
and i really enjoyed reading actually one paper from berkeley i think it just appeared this year from christopher
49:16
bartel and reviewing some of the approaches for stability metrics so thinking about
49:22
different thermodynamic potentials that we can incorporate and in terms of having more accurate
49:30
and reliable predictions so apologies for the rant for those sort of
49:37
a series of things were just on my mind recently and that sort of brings me to the end so
49:42
thanks if you stay till now that's great and so what i tried to get across was the predictive power of materials
49:48
modeling i think what i've seen in the last 20 years is incredible in terms of going from these
49:54
individual calculations solving concham equations to not thinking about tens of thousands of
49:59
materials but at the same time i think we need to be critical um of the models are being developed and
50:06
also of the data that we're training those models on if we're going to have robust and
50:11
meaningful predictions in the future so thanks to my research group and collaborate collaboration network i
50:17
know roshi yang one of my phd students she's working hard over in berkeley and thanks to everybody else
50:24
i think materials project and community has been quite forward thinking in terms of reproducible
50:31
science so i'm not going to dwell much in terms of sharing your codes and data
50:36
but thank you all for your attention
50:41
wait thank you so much aaron for the wonderful talk uh we do have some questions in the q a panel if you're
50:46
able to go ahead and review those uh apologies to anyone whose questions we're not able to answer in the next few
50:53
minutes but we will have the uh the link open the chairsproject.org seminars where you can repost the questions so
50:59
aaron are you able to see the question would you like me to moderate or are you able to see them yourself and we can try
51:05
to answer some of these let me just get my screen going and it should be fine
51:11
yeah go for it oh i i can see them i said you want me to just go through
51:16
sure sure yeah any order you'd like so okay so and and above you're an expert
51:23
on this topic so feel free to chip in as well and so there's one from gabriel mann
51:29
so can one predict based on atomic number alone which elements have chemically active
51:36
versus inactive lone pairs i think that's a really good question
51:42
and it's actually the one i gave to kazuki at the beginning of his phd
51:47
and he's coming to the end of it right now and back then i think it wasn't possible
51:53
um in order to produce to get a very sort of good clustering
51:58
there seems to be this very very delicate balance so even what i'm seeing in the lead halide compounds
52:05
there's a very large family of lead iodide systems with different counter irons
52:11
and with some counter rhines you end up getting an inactive lone pair so you get a regular octahedron in other cases then
52:18
you get this very projected lone pair so more sort of this um deformed either four or five
52:24
coordinate environment and i think there has to be a chemical explanation exactly why but i haven't
52:31
seen a good prediction yet in terms of classifying the behavior but i think that's a really really good question
52:38
so thanks for that gabriel and second question from robert wechsler
52:46
so there there have been some very impressive advances in using machine learning to fit interdiment potentials
52:52
or solve the many bodies schrodinger equation so these models however tend to be black box
52:57
which based on your talk today isn't always desired for an intuition in materials design
53:03
what's my perspective am i optimistic that simpler theories for materials
53:08
design will be discovered in the next decade so personally i think machine learning
53:15
atomic potentials are quite game-changing so i've been involved in quite a number of
53:22
projects in trying to train new classical potentials so taking some buckingham type potential
53:28
you have a set of observables you try to find a set of coefficients that fit this particular functional form
53:35
and it's a nightmare so it's often called a dark art that it's so difficult
53:40
to train a new interatomic potential and so people spend years trying to even
53:46
a system like titanium dioxide there's no robust interatomic potential for titanium dioxide
53:53
that can describe its various polymorphs and its instabilities and but machine learning
54:00
if you're thinking about sort of these um sort of gaussian approximation type potentials
54:06
they seem to do an incredibly good job with relatively little data
54:11
so instead of having a set of clear observables you just sample a set of perturbed structures
54:17
you train an effective model and it does a really good job so i think especially when you're treating with systems that
54:23
are polymorphic and if you have for example a crystalline to amorphous phase
54:30
transition and if you have some complex behavior that you want to describe these seem to do a
54:36
really really good job so i think for those types of materials it's going to be very useful and will go beyond
54:43
sort of solving the concham equations because you see they're not interpretable but even
54:50
dft is not very interpretable either in terms of you're solving this set of
54:55
partial differential equations that does map between structure and properties but
55:01
the inter interpretation is usually up to the user so do you interpret the system as
55:06
covalent or ionic and are you using sort of a cohp type approach there's many
55:11
different ways and i think machine learning is just like that i think the general trend is more interpretable
55:17
models so i'm very optimistic for the role of machine learning right now
55:23
um so a question for baja cahill so can we use synthetic data to fill in the missing
55:29
pieces so in principle yes i think it really depends on the type of project
55:35
and i think like others we try to do natural language processing to for example
55:40
extract data from the literature but you run into problems quite quickly
55:46
so if you take a material like zinc oxide and you try to do data mining of band gap
55:52
you'll get a very large range because different groups have different samples that have
55:58
different impurities different thicknesses different morphologies they fit their optical absorption in
56:05
different ways so you get a very large range in the values that have been reported
56:10
and so i think there's a lot of hidden variables in the experimental data that
56:16
are difficult to extract because they're not in the papers themselves so what with the background defect
56:21
concentrations what's the dominant orientation of you know of the of the crystals what's the
56:27
particle size so i think it's difficult but i think if you have a focus project where you're
56:33
really trying to calculate something that's directly being measured then i think it becomes very
56:40
useful to combine synthetic and predicted data but if you're trying to do it blindly from the literature i
56:45
think it's very very difficult i hope that answers your question
56:51
and next question from gabriel
56:57
gabriel gabriel is back again and given standard halo perovskites some
57:02
methylamonium lead bromide what are the smallest and largest terms in the hamiltonian
57:07
oh and how large is the unharmonic term relative to static potential term
57:13
so this is actually one of the really big questions right now and
57:19
there's many high profile papers talking about the high levels of anharmonicity
57:24
i think generally for these materials if you perform a harmonic and
57:29
phonon calculation so you calculate a set of frequencies typically the agreement is reasonable with respect to
57:36
experiment so you get infrared and raman peaks that are reasonable but you also
57:41
get a number of imaginary modes so imaginary modes that correspond to these
57:46
tilting of the octahedra as some dynamic instability so that's what the
57:52
um unharmonic theories allow you to capture so i think in in many cases
57:58
the room temperature phases are stapled by unharm and harmonic terms
58:05
so at low temperature you have a very rigid heavily tilted perovskite at room temperature they're heavily
58:11
dynamic that dynamic behavior is inherently unharmonic so you need to have a double
58:17
well type potential and but still i think if you're really asking about the order of the terms
58:25
the unharmonic results in a large contribution to the to the free energy but it's not enough
58:32
to describe the room temperature phases so you have to go beyond but i think that's a topic that's still
58:38
under active research and debate right now um also greetings to jacob and gavartan
58:46
who i think is that schrodinger and these days uh aaron thank you for
58:51
the thought-provoking talk with regards to the group theoretical analysis you mentioned that these distortions are
58:57
of yantellor or crystal feed splitting type it's known that these are not reduced
59:02
they're not reproduced at an lda gj level yet some distortions are represented
59:09
very well is there common wisdom on when gga can or cannot describe that's a really good question
59:16
i was a little bit lucky in this case so when you have lead to or tin to it's actually this second order
59:23
yanteller effect so it's not that you have a partially occupied state that's been split
59:30
by some on-site by some um some by correlation to give you a filled
59:35
and empty states it's that you get some coupling between field
59:40
and empty states that results in a much much more and
59:46
yeah the physics is it it's a little bit more easy to describe at the lda gga
59:51
level so this relates to the stereochemical activity or inactivity of the lone pairs
59:57
so i think if you're dealing with systems like certain transition metals it wouldn't do a good job here but
1:00:03
because it's led to and i think in this case it ends up being reasonable because it's this
1:00:08
second order yantella effect and so i think it's quite a special case
1:00:16
so lee zhang asks what's my view on
1:00:21
the questions keep jumping what's my view on machine learning's future to provide more mechanistic scientific
1:00:26
details matching those from dft rather than prediction slash
1:00:32
engineering so i think that's one of the other streams of research i think somebody
1:00:38
mentioned somebody mentioned and some of the deep learning work
1:00:43
on trying to have um trying to replace the many bodies schrodinger equation
1:00:48
so there's work i know there's a lot of work at deepmind so deepmind in london have hired a number of graduates from
1:00:54
um condensed matter physics in imperial i know as one example that have been working on
1:01:00
this type of problem so i would not be surprised in the next five years if we see a nature front cover where the
1:01:08
schrodinger equation has been replaced by a deep learning model in terms of the accuracy and generality
1:01:14
of predictions so it's replacing these pdes by a very large neural network
1:01:21
and of course a lot of effort is going to go into the training of that i think the question is once it's trained will
1:01:26
that be shared and are we going to be doing fewer and fewer dft calculations
1:01:33
and again i think it's going to depend on the property that you're interested in and so maybe if you care about energy
1:01:39
or some simple property that's fine i think there's still a lot of effort going to having more sophisticated response
1:01:45
functions for example optical properties or magnetic properties where we will still have development
1:01:51
using the traditional methods and i see annabath has joined back in so i
1:01:58
notice we're a few minutes over time at this point and there's still quite a bit of questions to go so my suggestion is
1:02:03
maybe we do a couple more questions and then uh any one whose questions were not answered maybe they can post them on
1:02:09
materialsproject.org seminars and then we can try and you know have a community discussion afterwards for some of these other ones
1:02:15
so aaron i'll leave it back to you but i realize we're kind of over time now so we might just want to do one or two more
1:02:22
okay yeah sort of dinner time in london but thanks for all the questions let me just answer two more and then
1:02:29
i will try to answer the rest online if you have them so am i aware of any methods looking into electron excitations or electron
1:02:36
forming coupling on the energy materials of finite temperatures and
1:02:42
what i've seen is i think separately in the quantum chemistry community
1:02:47
people have definitely been working on models for dealing with electronic excitations so going beyond tf dft and trying to
1:02:54
train um on sort of higher order sort of post-artery fog methods
1:03:00
separately i think we've seen that machine learning models can reproduce phonon
1:03:05
and density of states quite well but i haven't seen anything that's
1:03:12
predicting for materials electron phonon interactions i think one of the reasons
1:03:17
is they're quite expensive to calculate so we don't yet have the data sets that
1:03:23
enable training reasonable models so i think that's one of the bottlenecks
1:03:28
and it's generating a sufficiently large data set but i suspect some smart people are
1:03:34
working on that problem right now but thank you for that anonymous attendee
1:03:40
so final question from ebi sam do i expect new unknown features maybe a
1:03:46
combination of known features or new ones coming up as key parameters and predicting properties or as approximations to a reasonable
1:03:53
range i really hope so because for me that's
1:03:58
the exciting thing where if machine learning training all of these models
1:04:04
tells us something that we really didn't know and i think for classical potentials
1:04:10
there's a lot of understanding of the limitations of two body methods that when you have a pairwise potential
1:04:17
it cannot describe these types of phenomena you need to have three body or four body to describe
1:04:23
and that sort of tells you something about the nature of the interactions but if we end up identifying some particular
1:04:30
features that are very efficient for predicting mechanical properties of vibrational properties
1:04:35
and we can understand them i think that's really really cool and instead of just i think the first
1:04:41
wave of machine learning for materials was really throwing in every possible feature
1:04:47
all of these very random ones like the melting point of the element the range of the melting points the average
1:04:55
sometimes you end up getting a model that relies on that feature but it's very difficult as a
1:05:00
scientist to really understand is that a meaningful correlation or is
1:05:06
it just the fact that you had this random feature that's giving rise to a slightly better model
1:05:12
and so i am very very hopeful i think we're going to learn and learn a lot
1:05:17
and in terms of the features that end up performing well for particular classes
1:05:22
of property and i think that's the last question so
1:05:28
thank you all for being so engaged for asking and yeah i see annabelle
1:05:33
is back great so thanks so much aaron for the talk and for staying extra and in terms of answering the questions the link to
1:05:39
continue the discussion in case you have further questions is in the chat right now so please check that out uh thank
1:05:45
you again aaron and we look forward to seeing everybody at the next materials project seminar
